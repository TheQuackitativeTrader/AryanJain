## About Me

I am a Financial Engineering student at UCLA Anderson, and find passion in all aspects of a quantitative trade from the investment decision, and implementation to execution. I aim to integrate data and machine learning driven insights into quantitative finance in a way that seeks alpha while preserving economic explainability.

Before UCLA, I spent 3+ years at ION Group, starting as a Software Developer and later also contributing as a Product Manager role for algorithmic trading systems in fixed income market making. Iâ€™ve built and shipped execution and hedging tools used by top-tier banksâ€”balancing trading system design with client-facing responsibilities like product demos, onboarding, and trader configuration. That dual exposure gives me a unique edge: I can build complex systems and also explain and position them effectively to clients and stakeholders.

With a Computer Science background, I'm an experienced Python and C++ programmer, comfortable with both the theory and implementation of modern machine learning and deep learning modelsâ€”including LSTMs, Kalman Filters, and various regression/classification techniques.

## ðŸ“‚ Key Projects

### ** Effect of increasing concentration of Magnificent 7 in the S&P 500 **  
- Reconstructed historical S&P 500 index levels and returns from constituent-level data (1960â€“2024) using free-float market capitalization to mirror index methodology with >0.99 correlation with actual.
- Analyzed the impact of increasing concentration of the top 7 (by market cap) on S&P 500â€™s return attribution, volatility dynamics, and beta decomposition across different time periods.
- Developed and backtested enhancements to the Long Small-Cap / Short Large-Cap strategy by incorporating dynamic concentration-adjusted signals and crash regime predictions using HMM, GMM, and LSTM models.
